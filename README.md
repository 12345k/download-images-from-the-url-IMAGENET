# Download-images-from-the-url-IMAGENET

It is very simple scriprt to download images from the url. I just made for [Imagenet](http://www.image-net.org/) but it cam customized for any url link.

##### This script will run on python 3 above not in python 2 due to urllib packages

# Follow the steps

1) Paste the url to the link variable 

2) Remove the if condition 

```
if(count==10):
        break
```
 If you want to download more than 10 images
 
 
 ### Happy coding
